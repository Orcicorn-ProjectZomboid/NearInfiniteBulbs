description=By default bulbs last to 100% condition. This mod adjusts them to reach their maximum integer value of 2,000,000,000.  Thus "[i]near infinite[/i]" . Built upon the foundation previously created by "[i]LongLifeBulbs[/i]" and utilizes the "[url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=566115016]Item Tweaker API[/url]"

description=NOTE: The primary purpose here is to provide longer lasting lights for your house/base, however it will affect lights in cars as well.  Existing "[i]in-use[/i]" lights will need to be picked up and placed back in to their devices to get the new values.  Cars will still show as 100% once installed but should have the 2 billion percent values.

description=All light bulbs ([i]plain and colored[/i]) are configured with this new value of 2,000,000,000 max condition.
